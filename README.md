# Plane Tracker #

I don't like huge, slow, complicated, non-intuitive, odd-looking, bloated, add-riddled flight tracking apps. Plane Tracker is a simple, lightweight yet good-looking plane/flight tracking app.

Its free, has NO ADS, looks great, lets you set trips with multiple flights. That's it.
